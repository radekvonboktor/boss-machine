# Boss Machine

## Project Overview

In this project, you will create an entire API to serve information to a Boss Machine, a unique management application for today's most accomplished (evil) entrepreneurs. You will create routes to manage your 'minions', your brilliant 'million dollar ideas', and to handle all the annoying meetings that keep getting added to your busy schedule.

You can view a video demonstration of the final app here:

### To be implemented

As a bonus, you may implement routes to allow bosses to add and remove work from their minions' backlogs.

Schema:

- Work:
  - id: string
  - title: string
  - description: string
  - hours: number
  - minionId: string

Routes required:

- GET /api/minions/:minionId/work to get an array of all work for the specified minon.
- POST /api/minions/:minionId/work to create a new work object and save it to the database.
- PUT /api/minions/:minionId/work/:workId to update a single work by id.
- DELETE /api/minions/:minionId/work/:workId to delete a single work by id.

To work on the bonus with tests, you will need to remove their pending status. Open the **test/test.js** and edit that begins the /api/minions/:minionId/work routes tests. It should start with `xdescribe(` around line 689 of the test file. If you delete the `x` (so that the line simply starts with `describe(` and save the test file before re-running, your bonus tests will now be active.

In order to fully implement these routes, the database helper functions may not provide all the functionality that you need, and you may need to use router parameters or other methods to attach the `minionId` properties correctly and handle the edge cases property. Good luck!

## Testing

A testing suite has been provided for you, checking for all essential functionality and
edge cases.

To run these tests, first open the root project directory in your terminal. Then run `npm install` to install all necessary testing dependencies (you will only need to do this step once).

Finally, run `npm run test`. You will see a list of tests that ran with information
about whether or not each test passed. After this list, you will see more specific output
about why each failing test failed. While they are open in a terminal window, these tests will re-run every time you save server files. If you want to quit the testing loop, use `Ctrl + C`. If you only want to run the tests once, you can run the `mocha` command in the terminal from your project root directory.

As you implement functionality, run the tests to ensure you are implementing your routes and middleware correctly. The tests will additionally help you identify edge cases that you may not have anticipated when first writing your routes. You should also test the functionality on the frontend to make sure that things are working as intended. Feel free to add logging middleware to your server, it will help with debugging!
